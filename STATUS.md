# Status

Goal (from Remington, 2026-09-30): make Blocksmith play like the reference game as closely as practical —
every block, sparkstone, Emberdeep, End, terrain/caves/structures/villages with the same rarities, raids, the
Blight, and a completable game. Assets stay original/procedural (no copied textures, sounds or decompiled
code); mechanics, names and numbers follow the reference game.

## Naming (repo is public)
All player-facing names are Blocksmith's own: the Emberdeep (fiery dimension), the Hollow (void dimension), Hisser,
Voidwalker, Wailer, Cinderwisp, Boarling/Tusker, Shellsentry, the Blight (summoned boss), Deep Stalker + Murk blocks,
Hollow Wyrm, Marauder/Brigand/Conjurer/Hexling/Siegebeast raiders, Sparkstone circuits, Lumenstone, Deeprock, Onyxstone,
Duskium, Violite, Tidestone, Proving Halls, Forest Manor, Sea Temple, Buried Citadel, Boarling Keep, Hollow Spires...
Internal keys (block/item names, MobKind.keys, Dim raw values) are unchanged save IDs, so old worlds load as before.
No third-party text, textures, sounds or logos: everything is procedural or written for Blocksmith.

## CI (compile/test loop)
- `.github/workflows/mac.yml` (macos-14 arm64, Xcode 16 / Swift 6.0.3): `./build.sh` + `./snap.sh` on every push;
  PNGs, WAVs and logs force-pushed to the orphan branch `ci-snaps` (README embeds them).
- Harness flags: `--find <biome>`, `--torches`, `--flood`, `--mobs`, `--menu inventory|creative|crafting|furnace`,
  `--drops`, `--survival HP`, `--debug`, `--sim SECONDS`, `--dim emberdeep|end`, `--portal`, `--hostile`, `--nethermobs`,
  `--structure <kind>` (camera at the nearest structure's anchor), `--menu brewing|enchant|anvil|trade`, `--effects`,
  `--spawn kind[:profession|:armour material|boat:variant[:c]],...`, `--place block[:state],...`, `--beacon`, `--weather rain|thunder`, `--ticks SECONDS`,
  `--decor`, `--map`, `--banners`, `--fireworks`, `--menu loom|book|advancements`;
  `Blocksmith --sounds DIR`.

## Controls
Keyboard/mouse: WASD, Space (double-tap = fly in creative), Shift sneak, Ctrl sprint, LMB attack/mine (hold),
RMB use/place/eat (hold), MMB pick block, 1–9/scroll hotbar, E inventory, Q drop (Ctrl+Q stack), R swap off hand, F fly, T / slash commands,
F1 hide HUD, F2 screenshot (~/Pictures/Blocksmith), F3 debug, F5 camera (first person / behind / in front, with a player model).
Menus: click / right-click / shift-click, number keys swap with hotbar, click outside drops, arrow keys move the cursor, Tab switches creative tabs.
Controller (console layout): LS move (full forward = auto-sprint), RS look, A jump, B / RS click sneak (hold or toggle), L3 sprint,
RT attack/mine, LT use/place/eat, LB/RB hotbar, Y inventory, X pick block, D-pad ↓ drop (hold: whole stack), ↑ fly, → swap off hand,
← command console, View camera, Menu pause, Share screenshot. Options > Controller: southpaw sticks.
In menus: D-pad/LS move the cursor (held directions repeat), A take/place/select, X split/place one/previous value, Y quick move,
RT drop, B back/close, LB/RB tabs (options pages, creative tabs, advancement tabs, recipe book pages), RS / LT / RT scroll and page.
On-screen keyboard (Y in any text field): A type, X delete, Y space, LT shift, Menu done.

## Couch / TV mode (controller workstream)
Playing on the TV: pair the Xbox controller in System Settings > Bluetooth (hold the pairing button until the logo flashes
fast), plug the Mac into the TV, launch Blocksmith — it opens full screen and the title screen says "<pad> ready". Turn on
Options > Interface > Couch Mode for a bigger HUD; if the TV crops the edges raise Safe Area; on a 4K TV set
Options > Video > Resolution to 75% for a steady 60 fps on the M1.
- `PadManager` (Controller.swift): hotplugging with toasts, the pad dropping out mid-game pauses, player LED, battery shown in
  Options > Controller, rumble through CoreHaptics (hurt, explosions, mining, attacks, bow, landing, thunder, level up; strength option),
  and "last device used" so every prompt shows controller glyphs or key caps automatically (Options: Button Prompts auto/pad/keys).
- Button glyphs (Glyphs.swift): private-use characters drawn by the HUD text renderer as pixel-art badges (coloured A/B/X/Y,
  LB/RB pills, LT/RT triggers, sticks, D-pad arms, Menu/View/Share) and key caps / mouse buttons. Menu legends change with the hovered
  slot ("A Pick up  X Pick up half  Y Quick move" / "A Place all  X Place one"); pad cursor is a bright frame.
- Options (PauseMenu.swift): six pages switched with LB/RB — Keyboard & Mouse, Controller (look speed X/Y, look acceleration, invert,
  dead zone, aim assist, vibration, southpaw, sneak hold/toggle, auto-sprint, prompts), Video (render distance, fullscreen, start in
  fullscreen [default on], VSync, frame-rate cap, resolution scale, FOV, GUI scale), Audio (+ subtitles), Interface (GUI scale, couch
  mode, safe area 0–10 %, button hints, text background, hide HUD, debug), Accessibility (subtitles, colourblind-safe colours,
  text background, tutorial tips). D-pad left/right changes the highlighted setting; every row has a help line; long pages scroll.
  Settings persist in UserDefaults (Settings.swift `@Pref`).
- Menus shrink to a GUI scale that fits the screen and safe area (HudLayout.fitted), so couch mode on a 1080p TV never overflows.
- Worlds (WorldStore.swift): newest first with mode + last played; per-world Play / Rename / Copy / Delete (confirmation with Cancel
  selected; deletes go to the Trash). The open world can be copied but not renamed/deleted. Save and Quit to Title.
- Creative palette: 9 tabs (All, Building, Natural, Functional, Sparkstone, Tools & Combat, Food & Potions, Ingredients, Search) with
  an icon tab strip; Search filters by name (keyboard or on-screen keyboard).
- In game: contextual prompts bottom-right ("RT Mine  LT Place  X Pick Block"), LB/RB beside the hotbar, first-steps tutorial tips
  (look, move, jump, mine, place, inventory, hotbar), subtitles with left/right arrows, aim assist (view slows over hostile mobs and
  while mining; controller only).
- Harness: `--padtest` drives Game.tick with a simulated pad through ~45 checks (pause, options pages/values, keyboard typing,
  world copy/delete/rename, inventory, creative tabs/search, gameplay buttons, look, rumble, TV fit); a failure makes the run exit 3.
  `--pad` (pad glyphs), `--couch`, `--safe N`, `--hints`, `--padview keyboard|worlds|world|confirm|controls|title|video`.
  Options changed by the harness are restored and worlds live in a temp folder. Snapshot shots hide tips/prompts unless `--hints`.
- Not yet: key rebinding for keyboard or pad, controller-driven sign/book editing beyond the on-screen keyboard, a TV-sized
  loading screen.

## Rendering performance
- Solid cube faces are drawn first without alpha test (keeps the GPU's hidden-surface removal), cutout faces
  (leaves, plants, models) second; far chunks use "fast" leaves (no faces inside canopies). Section meshes are
  carved from pooled 4 MB slabs (one MTLBuffer per section cost a 16 KB page each: rd 24 resident 2.0 GB -> 1.1 GB).
  CI median-of-30 frames at rd 16: 5-7.5 ms on seeds 12345/777/424242, rd 24 12 ms.
- Greedy meshing of flat-lit cube faces (merged quads take repeating UVs from their position in the shader).
- LOD: chunks beyond 8 chunks mesh with flat light (fully merged), no plants/rails/dust, and skip faces facing pitch-dark
  cells; they re-mesh when crossing the boundary. Render distance goes up to 24 in Options.
- Cave culling: each section stores which faces connect through open cells; the renderer walks sections outward from the
  camera through connected faces only (plus frustum). CI rd 12 overworld frame: ~26 ms -> ~9 ms (VM GPU).

## Polish (latest)
- Auto-Jump option (hops one-block steps while walking into them; handy on a controller). Long pause/options pages
  use two columns so they fit couch-mode GUI scales.
- Poses: sprint-swimming (0.6 tall, follows the view), crawling when there is no headroom, forced crouch under
  1.5-high gaps (sneak height 1.5, eye 1.27).
- Mob navigation: A* over block cells (walk, jump one, drop three, swim; avoids lava/fire/cactus/fence tops) for
  every mob walking towards something (chasing, food, beds, job sites); 4 searches / 1.5 ms per tick. --pathtest: a zombie
  walks around a 17-block wall to the player in ~9 s.
- Ashen Grove biome (high-weirdness dark forest): Ashbark wood family, ashen moss/carpets, hanging moss,
  nightblooms that open at night, Barkwraith hearts in trunks and the Barkwraith (moves only unobserved, dies with its heart).
- Torch light follows the reference curve with the default-brightness gamma lift; harness moves the camera out of
  solid blocks, finds cave biomes (lush_caves, dripstone_caves, deep_dark); trees stay out of structure footprints.
- Command console (T or /, or Commands... in the pause menu): /time /weather /gamemode /difficulty /tp /give /summon
  /kill /clear /effect /xp /locate /seed /spawnpoint /setblock with Tab completion, history and pad quick buttons.
- Third-person cameras (F5 / View) stop short of blocks and show an original player model with armour and held item.
- Nether wood family shown as Rustcap / Tealcap (display names only).
- Title screen at launch; recipe book in crafting screens (craftable/all, fills the grid).
- Death screen (message, score, Respawn / Title Screen; XP drops as orbs), live compass / recovery compass / clock icons.
- Background music director (calm procedural pieces every 10-20 min, dimension moods), cave ambience, disc titles.
- Landing / sprint dust, item equip animation, denser rain with ground splashes lit by daylight.
- Village life: beds and sleeping, food pickup + breeding, farmers harvesting, golems, midnight zombie sieges.

## Known gaps / decisions
- Save format changed with the engine rework (chunks3/, name-paletted); worlds from the 8-bit engine start fresh terrain.
- Terrain is generated with our own noises and numbers: same features, biome logic, rarities and ore distributions as the reference game, but not seed-identical worlds.
- Structure placement is deterministic per chunk: every piece is computed from world position, so structures spanning chunks line up.
- Structures: generated chests/spawners are block entities installed when the chunk generates; a chunk that
  unloads unmodified regenerates but keeps the existing (possibly looted) block entity.
- Emberdeep light: dimension ambient lifts the whole light curve (0.3 in the Emberdeep), approximating the reference
  game's ambient + default-brightness gamma.
- Mobs are saved per chunk (mobs.json) and come back when their chunk loads; natural hostiles are not kept.
- Credits text is original (the reference game's poem is not copied).
- Wall torches stand upright against the wall (no tilt). Armor trims show in the tooltip (the player model isn't drawn in first person).
- Raids are not saved across a reload (an unfinished raid ends); the void chest, weather and insomnia timer are.
